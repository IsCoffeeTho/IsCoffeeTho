# Welcome!
Hello, My name is Aaron Menadue.
I am an Aussie Software Engineer that started programming in 2013, currently undertaking a study at [42 Adelaide](https://github.com/42Adelaide).
Started making really crude websites and then got the courage to try Unity Games, from Unity games to Desktop Apps.
I recently started getting into 'emulation' and simulation of systems. I really enjoy using programming as a means to have a unique challenge.

I also love making music and being creative. There is soo much more to learn for me, but when is there never anything to learn.
